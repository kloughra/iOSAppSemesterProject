Usage
=====

The app opens up to a table view on top of a Facebook Login button. You must log into Facebook before
really using the app. If you try to access the different options, an alert will pop up and tell you to log in.

The top of the list is a History section. Clicking on this will lead the user to a very simple view control with a
blurb about the history of the club.

The next is a team roster. Clicking here leads you to a list of the players. A + button at the top right hand corner
checks your credentials via Facebook and if you are authorized, leads you to another view controller that allows
a user to enter information about a new player. There are checks against wrong input (except for if the name you enetered
is not a Facebook user or on the rugby team. This will not break the app, but no photos will be found). You can add or cancel.
Back at the Roster you can click on any player and this will lead you to a view containing additional info about each player
and searches the ND Women's Rugby Page for photos of them in action. You can scroll through those photos, and clickin on one
will lead you one step further to a blown up version of the photo.

The next is a Schedule. This is another fairly simpler view controller. This loads a map with a pin in the ND Rugby field
so it can be viewed where it is on campus. Below that is a sinmple scrollable schedule in plain text and a photo of 
players on the home field in action.

Next is a News & Updates section. This section is for all users to view and administrators to add to. You can see here
news and updates, but if you try to add an update, an alert will direct you to the Share & Comment section. Otherwise,
clicking the + button will lead to another view control allowing you to add text, a photo or both.

Finally is the Share & Comment section, similar to the News & Updates section, which any user can add to and view. Due to
time constraints, the user name is not added, I broke it when I tried last to add.
